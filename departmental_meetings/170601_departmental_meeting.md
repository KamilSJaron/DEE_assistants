## public defense of PhD theses

The professors would like to remind you that these public presentations of your research must both 
1) have enough scientific content to interest your colleagues and contribute to highlight the research carried out in our department
2) and also be of interest to a wider public such as families and friends there. 

They apparently found that the presentations were sometimes only aimed to one of these two crowds.

In addition, they would like to ask you that, from now, it would be better to do the "acknowledgements" part of your talk, as well as, if there is one, the small presentation prepared by your colleagues for instance, only AFTER the thesis committee met to award the diploma.
