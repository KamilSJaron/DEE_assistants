15th of May 2017 ~25 PhD students and post-docs have met in Biophore Auditoire. We used pink and green stickers to show a support to different statements, those were calculated approximately and here reported in bracketed after the statements. People were leaving over time

## Representatives

Not everybody have been aware of his representation on any level. At the same time it was not clear to everyone what is the purpose of our representation. We have not came with a solution to this issue.

---

We searched for a representative of post-docs in subcommittee for PhD students and Postdocs. **Paul** has volunteered for this position and gain a full support of all present assistants. (all yes)

## Teaching load

The most of assistants feel that the teaching load differs a lot between different assistant. The ability to speak French was suggested as putative reason for the difference, mainly for assistants teaching bachelor courses together with non-French speakers.  (feeling about different teaching load: vastly yes, 2 for no)

However, we agreed that we need data to support the perception, therefore we would like to see and share statistics of teaching load of all assistants that are collected in the end of each semester. If we do not get the stats, we will have to do a survey by our own!

---

Assistants teach subject what is not their domain on short notice and they do not feel prepared as they should be. There should be more focus on assistants being actually instructed or as least they should get materials (powerpoint) of what is going to be done in the practicals.

An assistant gave an example of a course, where the last week the presentation was provided one day ahead.

## Language issues

The most of assistants acknowledge that the French is the language of department. However, there some cases where translations would be very helpful:
- an unofficial translation of official contracts
- the webpages of language courses and MyUniL.

---

Related to teaching, some assistants believe that DEE should support, promote and organise French lessons for all the assistants that have to teach French courses or to the all th e assistants. The English courses would be useful for French speakers.

## Scientific and Academic concerns

Are you satisfied with courses in the doctoral program? (2 no, no other votes)

- general program is to medical
- missing ecological topic group (ecology student had to take genetic topic group)

---

All activities are academia-oriented. It would be nice, if we would be prepared to the most likely job market for the most of us - industry.

We could have seminars with industry people. There was a raised concern if the industry speaker would be able to deliver satisfying seminar.

Career days had not enough spaces for everybody and it is just once per year.

We like presence of industry on conferences (like Genomics Days).

## Should we have a departmental statistician?
(13 yes, 2 no)

A person employed by the department for consultations of individual project, potentially involved in teaching and/or seminars.

PhD students do not want to avoid statistics, they would like to have somebody that would verify their statistics and/or point them into right direction. A statistician would help to rise the confidence of assistants in their statistics.

Right now, people known to know bits of statistics are asked for advices which is not convenient on such big department.

If there are groups that have strong statistical background, are they open for collaborations with groups they are more biologically oriented? If yes, which groups?

Issues with having a statistician:
- One statistician will not be enough?
- It is not clear what kind of statistician should be hired?
- How do you divide the cost?

Alternatives:
- a Topic group dealing with particular statistics problems of students.
- courses of intermediate statistics (current courses are perceived either too basic or too difficult)

These alternatives not fully address the need of statistician.

## Christmas party and other social activities

The department is big and there is only one event per year where everybody meets. Some assistants have expressed an interest in more social activities of the whole department.

Also the Christmas party is in danger since many of the organizers have finished. Is there any group of students that would rescue the party? What is allowed budged? Could we have more of departmental parties per year?
